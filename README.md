# Rick and Morty App

## 📌 Introduction
This is an Android application developed in **Kotlin**, which fetches data from the **Rick and Morty API**.  
The project is built with **Jetpack Compose, Room Database, and Retrofit**, following the **MVVM architecture** to ensure scalability and clear separation of concerns.  
API documentation and testing are handled using **Swagger**.

---

## 🛠 Technologies & Frameworks
- **Language:** Kotlin
- **UI:** Jetpack Compose
- **Architecture:** MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
- **Data Handling:** Room Database (Local Storage)
- **API Integration:** Retrofit (Network Requests)
- **API Documentation & Testing:** Swagger / OpenAPI
- **State Management:** ViewModel & LiveData
- **Image Loading:** Coil
- **Navigation:** Navigation Component
- **Caching:** API response caching for optimized performance

## 📂 Project Structure
The app is organized into logical packages to ensure **modularity** and **maintainability**:
``` 
📦 com.example.rickandmortyapp
├── 📂 components          # Reusable UI components (CharacterItem, UserCharacterItem)
├── 📂 data                # Handles data operations
│   ├── 📂 dataclasses     # Data models for API & database objects
│   ├── 📂 retrofit        # Retrofit classes for API integration
│   ├── 📂 room            # Room Database classes & DAO
├── 📂 navigation          # Navigation logic (BottomNavigationBar, ScreenNavigation)
├── 📂 screens             # Main screens of the application
│   ├── 📂 characterlist   # Displays list of characters

```

## 📌 Features
### Character List Screen
- Fetches and displays a list of characters from the API.
- Implements **pagination** for smooth navigation between pages.

### Create Character Screen
- Allows users to create **custom characters**.
- Built-in **validation** to ensure valid input.
- Saves data in a local **Room Database**.

### Saved Characters Screen
- Displays a list of **user-created characters**.
- Data is **retrieved from the local database**.

### Random Character Screen
- Generates a **random character** from the API.
- Implements **caching** for faster loading.

## 🛠 Implementation Details
- **MVVM architecture** ensures that UI components handle only rendering, while ViewModels manage data flow and logic.
- **Retrofit** is used for API calls, with a separate repository layer handling network requests.
- **Room Database** ensures that user data is **stored locally** and remains accessible offline.
- **LazyColumn** is used for efficient rendering of **large datasets** in lists.
- **API documentation and testing with Swagger** ensures that all API calls are structured and verified before deployment.
